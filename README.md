This is my college project, I want to add some more features although my project has done but, I want to go further and develop this website on my own. 

Some of the files are irrelevent to this project so they guide you to confussion so those files requie your less attention please ignore them ...

Talking about Front-end
I used HTML and CSS to buitify my website this design is inspired by "REPLIT". Replit is a online compiler webapp which helps developer to compile there code, sync the files and provide many more facilities like this. index.html is my Home page and all the pages are in pages directory all pages are connected to navigation bar 

Talking about Back-end
For Authentication I have used PHP and Xampp server which help user to login and register. Login and register both functionalities work pefectly fine. API integration is done in editor.html which uses judgeo api. JS is used for basic purpose not that advance. The logout session is yet to add in this project.

API 
I simply used API to compile my code. "Judge0" is an excellent api to compile your code I used basic plan, you can go for premium as per your requirement. 

feel free to correct me ...
